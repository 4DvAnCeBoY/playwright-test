# ðŸŽ­ Playwright Runner
> This repository is not ready for use. If you want to run tests with [playwright](https://github.com/Microsoft/playwright), checkout [jest-playwright](https://github.com/mmarkelov/jest-playwright) for Jest or [karma-playwright-launcher](https://github.com/JoelEinbinder/karma-playwright-launcher) for Karma.

## Usage

1. `npm i --save-dev jest playwright-runner ` or `yarn add --dev jest playwright-runner`
2. Specify `playwright-runner` in your Jest configuration:
```json
//jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  "preset": "playwright-runner"
}
```
3. Place unit tests in files ending with `.spec.*` or `.test.*`.
```js
// src/App.spec.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { App } from './App';

it('should work', function() {
  const container = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, container);
  expect(container.textContent).toBe('Hello World');
});
```
4. Place end-to-end tests inside an `e2e` folder.
```js
// e2e/basic.test.js
it('is a basic test with the page', async ({page}) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const home = await page.waitForSelector('home-navigation');
  expect(await home.evaluate(home => home.innerText)).toBe('ðŸŽ­ Playwright');
});
```
5. Run all of your tests with `npx jest` or `yarn jest`
